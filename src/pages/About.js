      <h1>About Gourmetly</h1>

      <p>
        Gourmetly is a modern, user-friendly recipe and meal-planning web application 
        created for anyone who wants to take control of their daily eating habits. 
        Whether you're a busy student, a working professional, or simply a food lover 
        who enjoys discovering new dishes, Gourmetly provides the tools you need to 
        organize, explore, and enjoy meals with ease.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        In today’s fast-paced world, planning meals and maintaining a healthy routine 
        can be a real challenge. Gourmetly was built to simplify that process. 
        Instead of jumping between notes, screenshots, and random recipe links, 
        Gourmetly puts everything in one clean, accessible platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help you save time, reduce stress, and turn cooking into 
        something you look forward to—not a daily chore.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Can Do With Gourmetly</h2>
      <p>
        Gourmetly gives you the flexibility to explore a variety of carefully selected 
        recipes, filter them by type, and access detailed preparation instructions. 
        You can build a full weekly meal plan using our curated menu, add dishes with a 
        single click, and remove them whenever your schedule or cravings change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each recipe includes ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and images to 
        help guide you through the cooking process. Our structured layout ensures that 
        even beginners can follow along confidently.
      </p>

      <h2>User Experience and Design</h2>
      <p>
        A great experience matters. That’s why Gourmetly features:
      </p>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
        <li>A clean, elegant interface inspired by real culinary websites</li>
        <li>Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile users</li>
        <li>Dark and light mode options for comfortable viewing</li>
        <li>Polished recipe cards with attractive images</li>
        <li>Smooth navigation and an intuitive layout</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Everything was designed with simplicity and visual clarity in mind, ensuring 
        that users of all ages can enjoy the app without confusion or clutter.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Gourmetly Stands Out</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike typical recipe websites that overload users with ads and long scrolling 
        pages, Gourmetly is fast, structured, and distraction-free. It is built 
        specifically as a practical tool—not just a recipe catalog—by integrating 
        planning, browsing, and cooking into a single seamless experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Gourmetly is more than a recipe viewer. It's a step toward building a smarter, 
        customizable cooking assistant. In future versions, we aim to integrate features 
        such as personalized meal recommendations, user accounts, shopping list 
        generation, and nutritional tracking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until then, we hope Gourmetly becomes your go-to platform for discovering new 
        meals, organizing your week, and enjoying the joy of cooking—one recipe at a 
        time.
